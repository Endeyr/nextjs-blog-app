## Priority

User Authentication and Authorization:

- This is foundational for user engagement and interaction. Implementing authentication early ensures that users can create accounts, log in, and start engaging with your blog. Without this, other features like commenting and personalized experiences won't be effective.

Create and Edit Posts:

- Once users can authenticate, enabling them to create and edit posts is the core functionality of a blogging platform. This feature allows content creators to start sharing their ideas and engage with the audience.

Search Functionality:

- Search functionality enhances user experience by making it easier for readers to find specific content. Implementing this early helps with content discoverability and overall user satisfaction.

Categories and Tags:

- After enabling users to create and edit posts, implementing categories and tags will enhance the organization and discoverability of content. This feature provides structure to your blog and aids users in finding content relevant to their interests.

Comments:

- Comments are valuable for user engagement, but they can be added after the basic content creation and search functionalities are in place. This allows authors to focus on creating content initially, and later readers can engage through comments.
